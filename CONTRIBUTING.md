# Contribution Guidelines

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Add new project in this format: `|name|description|size-badge|`
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Description should not contain keywords like `tiny` `micro` `minimal` `browser`, since they're implied.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
- Don't start the description with A or An.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
